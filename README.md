# Used the w3schools website for the help
Mainly help for making a download link:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_download_link.asp <br>
Sometimes used to help me work out how to layout elements like divs.

Got help from Libor to create the live GitHub page, other than that I had no other issues with creating the website.

Mainly followed the colour scheme of my prototype of the portfolio but changed the layout and what I wanted to show.
